Generics:

Generics means parameterised types.

The idea is to allow any of the types (Integer, String, etc and userdefined types)
to be a parameter to Methods, classes, and interfaces.

Using Generics its possible to create classes that work with different data types.


Why Generics? 

Generics provides type safety. Object class which is the super class of all other classes
can refer to any object. So Generics was introduced to add type safety.

Generic Method:

Generic java method takes a parameter of any type.



Type parameters in generics:

T - Type

E - Element

K - Key

N - Number

V - Value
